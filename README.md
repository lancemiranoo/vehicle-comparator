Choosing the right vehicle has become challenging for potential buyers due to the overwhelming amount of information, specifications, and price variations available across different models. In addition, consumers often face difficulties in gathering details. This process involves visiting multiple websites or dealerships, making it time-consuming and inefficient. Additionally, the lack of platform that compares vehicle key factors makes decision-making even harder. To solve these problems, CarSpecify aims to provide a user-friendly web app that consolidates vehicle information, allowing users to efficiently compare specifications and prices, all in a single website.
